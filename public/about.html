<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 22 year old person from South Africa, with Greek heritage. </p>

<p>I love animals, superheroes, music, games, and storytelling. Because of this, it's hard for me to decide what field to go into for a career: animal rescue, music composition and songwriting, game design, writing, or the sciences. I also like Greek and Korean, and want to learn those languages and maybe even visit Greece and South Korea one day.</p>

<p>I'm learning web development because it teaches web creation and general coding, which are very useful skills to have, to be come a web developer or to use in other fields.</p>
