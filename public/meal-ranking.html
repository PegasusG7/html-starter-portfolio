<h2>My Top 3 Meals</h2>

<h3>(Because choosing movies was too hard)</h3>

<hr />

<h4>Cereal</h4>
<p>There are so many delicious cereals, but the best is Milo cereal. It's amazingly tasty and crunchy, and a treat to eat!</p>

<h4>Pizza</h4>
<p>Pizza is a classic for a reason. The best pizza is margherita pizza - bread, cheese and tomato; you don't need anything more than that.</p>

<h4>Spaghetti Bolognese</h4>
<p>When I was at school, my mom made me spaghetti bolognese every Monday; it helped me so much to get through the school day!</p>
